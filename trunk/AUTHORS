and fbpanel is derived from another project, fspanel [3], originally 
written by Peter Zelezny.

* src/plugins/menu.c contains few pieces of code from menu.c of gnome-panel.

* gtk-builder-convert is a fixed version of the original program included in
  gtk+ package. It's originally developed by gtk+ developers, but it contains
  some bugs. So a fixed version is included here.
